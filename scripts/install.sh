# directory. Join stays a separate step: run `quartet connect` (or
# `quartet connect --hub …`) afterwards. This does not start a daemon and does
# not run `jazz daemon install`.
#
# Environment variables:
#   QUARTET_INSTALL_DIR   Directory to install into (default: $HOME/.local/bin)
#   QUARTET_VERSION       Quartet version to install, e.g. v0.2.0 (default: latest)
#   JAZZ_VERSION          Jazz version to install, e.g. v0.13.12 (default: latest)
#   QUARTET_SKIP_JAZZ     Set to 1 to install quartet only (escape hatch)
